### Welcome to my GitHub Repository for CIT-281

### Project#1
Description: The perpose of this project was to teach us how to use the Command Line Interphase (CLI). Specifically to learn how to create folders, list them in a tree-like structure, use the ping command, and practice using the break keyboard sequence. We also had to code a javascript function which returned to the console a string of random length between 5 - 25 characters (range inclusive) in length, that consists of all random lowercase letters from the English alphabet.

### Project#2
Description: The perpose of this project was to teach us how to create and save our changes in a git repo file. We learned how to commit our initial code, any subsequent changes to it, and how to create a .gitignore file. For the javascript portion we had to code two functions. The first one was a function called getRandomLetter() which returns a single, random, lowercase letter. The second on was a function called getRandomString(minLength, maxLength) that returns the length of a randomly generated string between 10 and 20 characters long. It also draws some functionality from the previous function.

### Project#3
Description: The perpose of this project was to teach us how to use the Fastify Get verb and practice using routes and query parameters. For the javascript part we had four functions to code. The first was a function called validDenomination(coin) which returns true if the coin function parameter is a valid coin value of either 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100. The second was a function called valueFromCoinObject(obj) which returns the calculated value of a single coin object from the obj function parameter. The third was a function called valueFromArray(arr) which iterates through an array of coin objects and returns the final calculated value of all coin objects. The final function was called coinCount(...coinage) which calls and returns the result of the valueFromArray() function which is the value of all coin objects with the coinage array function parameter. 

### Project#4
Description: The perpose of this project was to teach us how to create a rest API server and test web server routes in Postman. For the javascript part we had to create serveral arrays that returned either question elements or answer elements and their respective numbers. For the postman all you have to do to get the to work right is type in the correct url/pathway and the results will be displayed.

### Project#5
Description: This project was optional and was offered as extra credit. The perpose of this project was to see if we could figure out how to complete the code to get the monster program to work properly. Since it was extra cretit and optional I choose to skip it in favor of studying for other classes so there is no code as a result. 

### Project#6
Description: The perpose of this project was to teach us how to code classes that inherit some of their functionality from a base class. The base class is called Shape and it creates an empty array of sides for all shapes as well as sets their starting perimeter to zero until test input is given. The first class to inherit from Shape is Rectangle which creates a rectangle by processing it's length and with as sides thanks to it's inheritance and calculates it's area. The other class to inherit from Shape is Triangle which does the same things as the rectangle class but for Triangles instead.

### Project#7
Description: The perpose of this project was to create this repository so we would be able to use it as a coding portfolio for job interviews. It also has the benefit of giving us more experience with creating github repos.
