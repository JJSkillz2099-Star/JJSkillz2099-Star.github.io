### Welcome to my GitHub Repository for CIT-281

### Project#1
Description: The perpose of this project was to teach us how to use the Command Line Interphase (CLI). Specifically to learn how to create folders, list them in a tree-like structure, use the ping command, and practice using the break keyboard sequence. We also had to code a javascript function which returned to the console a string of random length between 5 - 25 characters (range inclusive) in length, that consists of all random lowercase letters from the English alphabet.

### Project#2
Description: The perpose of this project was to teach us how to create and save our changes in a git repo file. We learned how to commit our initial code, any subsequent changes to it, and how to create a .gitignore file. For the javascript portion we had to code two functions. The first one was a function called getRandomLetter() which returns a single, random, lowercase letter. The second on was a function called getRandomString(minLength, maxLength) that returns the length of a randomly generated string between 10 and 20 characters long. It also draws some functionality from the previous function.
